## [Spotify Chart History](https://kworb.net/spotify/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX.html)
The linked data will be the main dataset that will be used in creating the map of BTS's global expansion over the years. The dataset includes the chart standings of most, if not all, BTS songs, in every country, with the song's 
peak data, which refers to the date the song reached its highest chart rating. 
## [BTS Live Performances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BTS_live_performances#Tours)
The linked data will be the second dataset used in creating the map of BTS's global expansion over the years. The following data features all the locations where BTS toured as well as the dates of the tours. The data will serve to support the narrative of BTS's rapid global expansion. This data will be separated into seven categories: Date, Event, City, Country, Venue, Latitude, and Longitude. Latitude and Longitude values will be added manually based on the venue locations.
