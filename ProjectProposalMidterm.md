## Overview
The purpose of this project is to understand and analyze the influence of South Korean pop group, Bangtan Sonyeondan (aka BTS) on several countries across the world. Our goal is to communicate and contextualize their global impact and contributions to a wider audience.  

BTS is inarguably one of the most well known music groups in the world. They debuted from a small, unrecognized entertainment company and paled in comparison to the three K-pop industry giants at the time. After enduring heavy criticism from Korean media outlets for years, BTS perservered and rose to becoming one of the greatest performers to exist. The seven-member boy group has broken records across Spotify, YouTube, Billboard, and TikTok, and have even become the first South Korean act to be nominated for a Grammy. 

Although the group started in South Korea, they are adored globally. They are popular in several countries across North America, South America and Asia. Besides breaking music records across the world, BTS is also credited with being the most influential group for fashion in Japan <sup>(<a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/survey-asks-which-country%E2%80%99s-fashion-is-the-most-influential-in-japanese-street-style" target="_blank">1</a>)</sup>. Some even argue that their popularity has increased interest in anything Korea: music, language and tourism <sup>(<a href="https://awkwardlyvain.com/2020/08/17/the-cultural-impact-of-the-k-pop-group-bts-around-the-world/" target="_blank">2</a>)</sup>. Needless to say, this group has had a great impact in several areas of culture, and our team is dedicated to analyzing their global influence by tracking their rise to fame in different countries across several continents in the world.

## Methodology
Web mapping is a personalizable tool that helps us display geographic data. With this, we are able to deliver information regarding global trends. Through mapping we are better able to visualize the global impact of BTS, as well as tracking their growth from their home country South Korea to now charting in various countries around the globe. Our interactive map will be based off of information from their tours, performances, and Spotify data.

## Technical scope
Find the technologies and how we will be utilizing them for our project below:
-   **Git/GitHub**: collaborate with each other and easily share files.
-   **HTML**: create the foundation for our website.
-   **CSS**: style the website.
-   **JavaScript**: implement Leaflet and more interactive components on our website.
-   **Python**: access and analyze data.
-   **Leaflet**: visualize geographical locations with this mapping library.

## Geographic scope
Our aim is to research BTSâ€™s growing popularity across the world to reflect trends in the globalization of K-pop. We will examine and collect data on a <b>global scale</b>. 

## Data
### [Spotify Chart History](https://kworb.net/spotify/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX.html)
The linked data will be the main dataset that will be used in creating the map of BTS's global expansion over the years. The dataset includes the chart standings of most, if not all, BTS songs, in every country, with the song's 
peak data, which refers to the date the song reached its highest chart rating. 
### [BTS Live Performances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BTS_live_performances#Tours)
The linked data will be the second dataset used in creating the map of BTS's global expansion over the years. The following data features all the locations where BTS toured as well as the dates of the tours. The data will serve to support the narrative of BTS's rapid global expansion. This data will be separated into seven categories: Date, Event, City, Country, Venue, Latitude, and Longitude. Latitude and Longitude values will be added manually based on the venue locations.
### [BTS Takeover Timeline](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-takeover-timeline-bbmas-8455612/)
The linked data will be used to construct the timeline of BTS's musical success over the years. The data will serve to construct the foundation of our project's narrative. The timeline will give a brief history into the musical success of BTS through their career.
