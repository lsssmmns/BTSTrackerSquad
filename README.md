## Technical scope
Introduce the technologies that project will use (Git, Leaflet, HTML, Javascript, etc) and what role each one will play (a diagram might be helpful)
-   **Git/GitHub**: collaborate with each other and easily share files.
-   **HTML**: create the foundation for our website.
-   **CSS**: style the website.
-   **JavaScript**: implement Leaflet and more interactive components on our website.
-   **Leaflet**: visualize geographical locations with this mapping library.

## Geographic scope
Our aim is to research BTSâ€™s growing popularity across the world to reflect trends in the globalization of K-pop. We will examine and collect data on a global scale.

## Data
Our project will mainly capture data from <a href="https://kworb.net/spotify/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX.html" target="_blank">BTS Spotify Chart History</a> and a Spotify API to acquire BTS Spotify streams statistics according to year and country. We also plan to manually enter country coordinates and release dates of songs, released by BTS, onto the existing dataset to better map the data.
