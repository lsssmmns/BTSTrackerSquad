## Technical scope
Introduce the technologies that project will use (Git, Leaflet, HTML, Javascript, etc) and what role each one will play (a diagram might be helpful)
-   **Git/GitHub**: collaborate with each other and easily share files.
-   **HTML**: create the foundation for our website.
-   **CSS**: style the website.
-   **JavaScript**: implement Leaflet and more interactive components on our website.
-   **Leaflet**: visualize geographical locations with this mapping library.

## Geographic scope
Introduce the geographic scale that your project will take (global, USA, California, Los Angeles County, multi-scale, etc)

## Data
Introduce at least two datasets that will be included in the project (include links as necessary). Make sure the data is "mappable" either by manual data entry, through an API, or by downloading it.
