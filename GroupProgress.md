# Group Progress Report

## Documenting Map and Narrative Inspiration
As we begin this project we are looking for inspiration to underline two different areas of our research: Digital mapping components and narrative. We are looking at other interactive maps to identify key features we may want to incorporate into our map to best illustrate our narrative. However, we are still discussing what research questions we can ask to present a narrative regarding the cultural impact of BTS rather than report on their mere popularity. 
### Mapping Features
We’ve currently looked at at least three different maps for inspiration of key mapping features.
#### The Musical Maps
This is a final project from a previous DH 151 group. The group showed musical trends from 2019-2020 by mapping concerts of different genres across the globe. The markers on the map indicate a venue in which a concert for a particular genre was held, the color of the marker differentiates between the years 2019 and 2020, and the size of the marker indicates how popular either the concert or the artist was at the time. Although we are unsure about the popularity feature of this map, we recognize that filtering markers by genre, and using both color and size to differentiate between the years and other key details is something that we would like to use in our final presentation of the BTS map. 

Aside from key features, we find the map to be aesthetically pleasing. There are a lot of markers on the map for each genre, and keeping a minimalist design allows the user to focus on the data rather than other elements. 

#### Migration in Motion

This map demonstrates migration patterns in mammals, birds and amphibians across the world by using continuous moving lines. Color allows the user to differentiate between the three categories. Although we are not sure we are not looking to pursue a map that mimics this one, we did like the way the data and research question is contextualized within a component on the bottom left of the map. The little box is somewhat of a slideshow presenting the main research question and purpose of the map without taking from the content on the actual map. 

#### Novel Coronavirus Healthmap

This map does not have a lot we can take from. It maps the amount of COVID-19cases from January 2020 to present using different color markers to represent the density of COVID-19 cases; the data can also be filtered by country by clicking on or searching for the country name on the sidebar. Our favorite feature from this map was the “Play” button at the bottom. When clicked, the map is brought to life as COVID-19 case markers start to pop out on the map in chronological order. 

### Possible Narrative
We also read through and looked at two different ways we could incorporate the popularity of BTS into a larger discourse regarding their cultural impact.

#### [Isabella Ding -- Dewy Skin Over Scruffy Beards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqrcCN8rOMc&list=PLAZz1xWL6At3kuncaIrQZUG4LZskUKhEA&index=11)
In her research, Isabella Ding discussed the way South Korean pop artists received backlash for their appearances by Western audiences. 

With the rise to stardom of BTS, more people around the world became aware of what was considered to be a Korena beauty standard for men; many people resorted to unwarranted criticism. In the eyes of western audiences, these men who were glorified for their dewy skin were not masculine enough. This created a chain of racist remarks invalidating South Korean beauty standards. The popularity of BTS may be directly tied to this phenomenon,  making it an interesting narrative to explore. 

#### [BTS and South Korean Economy](https://shadow-twts.medium.com/the-bts-effect-on-south-koreas-economy-industry-and-culture-975e8933da56)
According to this particular source, the Hyundai Research Institute has estimated that BTS generates about 3 billion US dollars, about 4 trillion won, as economic value to the country per year, with increasing estimates in following years. Not only is their economic effect larger than any other Orean artists, but their popularity has had a great impact on South Korean tourism and it has piqued others’ interest in the culture. The article details BTS’s impact on the economy of South Korea across several industries: Music, clothing cosmetics, and food. The popularity of BTS has vastly impacted the trajectory of the country’s economy, making this a viable and almost necessary narrative to explore via the band’s popularity. 


## Website Design
![BTS Photo](/photos/BTS.png "BTS")
Generally we want the site to be fun and sleek. We think it would be cool to mimic the BTS website so it’s fun for fans and conveys a sense of credibility on the subject matter. We would like to keep all the storytelling elements on one page, so it’s important to be very organized so as much information as possible can be fit into a small space (don’t want to have to scroll for hours). Some interesting features to implement are: a play button that shows the user the mapping data changes over a certain time period, have multiple overlapping datasets which can be added or removed from the map using checkboxes, create start page that walks through the data narrative using a slideshow format.
### Inspiration
  * [https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19/](url)
    * play button walk through data visualization over the time
  * [https://justisg.github.io/TheMusicalMaps/Website/index.html](url) 
    * info button: describe how to use site
    * select buttons: decide what data (colorcoded) shows up on the map
    * map concerts (could map BTS performances)
        - use popularity (from twitter data???) to make the marker proportionally larger/smaller
  * [http://maps.tnc.org/migrations-in-motion/#3/25.56/-102.66](url)
    * corner popup walks through the data narrative (See possible sections below:)
        - Introduce the project
        - How was it made?
        - How can the data be used?
        - Credits
        - Read more
        - References
  * [https://ibighit.com/bts/kor/discography/](url)
    * I want to kinda mimic BTS’s style bc I think that would be fun
    * could put a fuzzy camera filter (mildly sepia) over our team photos to mimic the BTS style
    * tend to do a lot of layering of rectangles and semitransparent overlays
    * a mix of very bright contrast colors (bright teal, barbie pink, orange, yellow) and hazy basics (black, white, and sepia) (fun constrast!)
    * usually the backgrounds are bright
    * scrollable, 4 sections (album+description, video, photo slideshows, track list)
    * 5% border radius on buttons or links in lists
    * use BTS fonts [https://twitter.com/bts_fonts](url) 

## How Our Site Will Help a Particular Cause
By creating this site, we hope that we can effectively depict trends in the global popularity of BTS. We aim to tell a compelling story that maps out stages of BTS’s career in an engaging, intuitive and interactive way. By drawing inspiration from other projects and mapping sites, we will implement a design that depicts the trajectory of BTS’s career over the years and also portrays their personal style.  

## Team Member Responsibilities

### Yahaira Cortez
Cortez took the lead on conducting a detailed overview of the datasets we planned to use for our projects based on the discussions we had in class on Monday April 11. She compiled a list of about 5 data sets with key points pertaining to what the data outlines and how we can use it for our project. 

### Hannah Kim
Kim took the initiative to begin to set the trajectory of our project. We discussed potential narratives our data and interactive map can show and she used our discussions to set goals for the narrative we present in our final product. She also took the lead on compiling visual aids for our GitHub documentation as well as visuals we can also use in our midterm and final presentations.

### Mariana Orozco-Berber
Orozco-Berber was in charge of sharing inspiration websites with the team to begin to brainstorm the narrative that will fram the interactive map. As project manager she also documents the group’s progress by keeping notes of each member’s responsibilities and progress to ensure we are on the same page in terms of long term goals for this project. Orozco-Berber took responsibility to applying for access to the Twitter API on tythe group’s behalf to have the information accessible if needed. 

### Alyssa Simmons
Simmons was in charge of articulating what the website would look like. She took suggestions from the group at our meeting on Monday April 11, and compiled a list of interactive maps she could use for inspiration. She also creates a UX stack detailing several components of the website and what the process would look like: Surface, skeleton, structure, user flows, scope and strategy.
