        <h1>BTS Tour History</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Wikipedia data features all BTS tours to date, detailing each show’s location, venue, date, number of attendees, and associated albums. Each dedicated tour page provides background information and a brief overview along with the complete tour setlist. The source clearly outlines the information needed to plot our data.</p>
        <h3>Data Silences</h3>
        <p>When reviewing the data, we noticed that only a couple of the tour pages included adequate context. Details regarding the popularity of K-pop and how BTS compared to other industry giants at the time are missing. It would be great to see data about how each tour was memorable in terms of bringing BTS closer to the level of fame they enjoy today.</p>
        <h1>Spotify Chart History</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As our primary dataset, the Spotify Chart History contains the chart ratings and number of streams for nearly all of BTS’s songs in each country. Each BTS song also has peak data, which refers to the date at which the song reached its highest chart standing. </p>
        <h3>Data Silences</h3>
        <p>The Spotify Chart History does not distinguish which BTS songs were released as singles. This information is valuable because their singles, also known as “comebacks” in the K-pop industry, have a separate promotion schedule. It would allow us to contextualize the song’s peak, since most BTS fans are committed to streaming and promoting the group’s comeback songs during the promotion period.</p>
